# This file is to build a AWGN channel with input (transmitter_signal, SNR) and output (output_signal)
# The channel is defined as:

#     noise ~ N(0, 1/SNR)
# The input signal and output signal are both in the form of torch tensor
# The input SNR is a scalar
# The output signal is the same shape as the input signal
